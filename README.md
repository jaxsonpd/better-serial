# better-serial

A serial terminal that isn't rubbish. This project was inspired by the
sorry state of the serial monitor offering avaiable especially on windows.
I spesifically was interested in the following features:

- Listing of avaiable serial ports 
- Ability to change default configuration
- Terminal interface (no seperate send box)
- Displaying of non visable ascii chars (this is my main gripe)
- Modern ish UI

## Installation
